# SteganographyAPI

we define a Flask application with a single endpoint /detect that accepts POST requests for steganography detection. The uploaded file is obtained from the request using request.files['file']. The is_steganographic_file function serves as a placeholder for your custom steganography detection logic. You can implement your own detection algorithm or leverage existing libraries.

Within the /detect route, we perform steganography detection on the uploaded file using the is_steganographic_file function. The result is then returned as JSON, indicating whether steganography was detected or not.

To run the application, save the code in a file (e.g., app.py), and execute it using Python. The Flask application will start running locally on the default port 5000. You can then send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/detect with a file upload to initiate steganography detection.

Remember to install the necessary dependencies, such as Flask, using pip install flask before running the code.

Please note that this is a basic implementation, and you may need to enhance it based on your specific requirements, such as adding authentication, handling different file types, or incorporating more advanced steganography detection techniques.
